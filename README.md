## 🧠 About the Project

Foroshi.ir was built to solve a very real need for learners who had previously enrolled in Maher Academy’s industrial electricity courses: **access to trusted, high-quality industrial electrical tools and equipment directly from a reliable source.**

Initially built as a simple WooCommerce store, the platform is designed with scalability in mind — it will soon transition into a **multi-vendor marketplace**, allowing manufacturers and sellers to list their own products and sell directly to customers.

The store is tightly integrated with marketing strategies from the main academy site and offers:

- Dynamic product filtering
- Custom ACF-based product specifications
- Mobile-friendly UI/UX using Elementor
